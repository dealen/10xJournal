## 🐛 Detailed Bug Documentation

### Bug #1: Session Persistence Failure
👉 **[session-persistence-fix.md](./session-persistence-fix.md)**

**Error:** `401 Unauthorized`

**What was broken:**
- Sessions not persisted to browser storage
- Users lost authentication after page refresh
- All API calls failed with 401 errors

**What was fixed:**
- Created `BlazorSessionPersistence` service
- Configured Supabase client to save/restore sessions
- Changed client from Singleton to Scoped
- Added session restoration on app startup

**Files modified:**
- `BlazorSessionPersistence.cs` (NEW)
- `Program.cs` (MAJOR REFACTOR)

### Bug #2: Foreign Key Constraint Violation
👉 **[foreign-key-constraint-fix.md](./foreign-key-constraint-fix.md)**

**Error:** `409 Conflict` - `23503 Foreign Key Violation`

**What was broken:**
- Database triggers removed (migration `20251012123000`)
- Registration only created auth user
- No profile records created
- Journal entries couldn't be inserted (missing parent record)

**What was fixed:**
- Updated `UserProfile` model with PostgREST attributes
- Enhanced registration to create profile and streak records
- Moved trigger logic to application code
- Created backfill script for existing users

**Files modified:**
- `UserProfile.cs` (MODIFIED)
- `SupabaseAuthService.cs` (ENHANCED)

**Migration required:**
- `backfill-user-profiles.sql` (for existing users)

## ⚡ TL;DR

**Problem:** Users couldn't create journal entries

**Root Causes:**
1. Sessions not persisted → 401 Unauthorized
2. Profiles not created → 409 Foreign Key Violation

**Solution:**
1. Implemented session persistence in localStorage
2. Added profile creation to registration flow

**Testing:**
1. Run backfill SQL for existing users
2. Clear browser storage
3. Test registration and entry creation
4. Verify no errors in console

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Build successful, ready for testing
