10xJournal Development Summary
This document summarizes the key steps taken to set up and develop the 10xJournal MVP project, from initial planning to the current state. Each step is outlined below, focusing on the rationale, actions performed, and alignment with project guidelines (e.g., Vertical Slice Architecture, simplicity, and minimalist philosophy).

Step 1: Initial Project Analysis and MVP Certification
Rationale: Assessed the project against the 10xDevs MVP criteria to identify gaps between planning (PRD, tech stack) and implementation.
Actions: Ran the #check-mvp tool, which confirmed the PRD was complete but highlighted missing code (e.g., authentication, CRUD, tests, CI/CD).
Outcome: Verified that the plan supports all MVP requirements; implementation was the next focus.
Alignment: Emphasized pragmatic, risk-based testing strategy (integration tests prioritized over unit tests).
Step 2: Updated Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Rationale: Enhanced the PRD to include Progressive Web App (PWA) support as a high-priority feature, aligning with offline requirements and low-effort implementation.
Actions: Added PWA to non-functional requirements and prioritized it alongside future features like dark mode.
Outcome: PRD now explicitly supports PWA for better offline experience, using service workers for caching.
Alignment: Maintained simplicity by choosing PWA over complex alternatives; followed readability-focused documentation practices.
Step 3: Project Cleanup and Simplification
Rationale: Removed unnecessary template files and dependencies to enforce the minimalist ethos and prevent distractions.
Actions: Deleted Counter.razor, Weather.razor, sample-data, Bootstrap (from wwwroot/lib), and unrelated files like GEMINI.md.
Outcome: Project now contains only essential components, reducing bloat and focusing on journaling features.
Alignment: Adhered to "Simplicity First" principle; avoided over-engineering by keeping only needed assets.
Step 4: Restructured to Vertical Slice Architecture
Rationale: Organized code by features (not technical layers) for better maintainability and to minimize dependencies.
Actions: Created /Features/ directory with subfolders for Authentication (Login, Register, Logout) and JournalEntries (CreateEntry, ListEntries, EditEntry, DeleteEntry). Added placeholder .razor components with basic UI and routes.
Outcome: Self-contained feature slices (e.g., all login logic in one folder) ready for development.
Alignment: Strictly followed Vertical Slice guidelines: no horizontal layers, direct Supabase communication, and co-located UI/logic.
Step 5: Integrated Tech Stack and PWA Support
Rationale: Implemented the specified tech stack (Blazor WASM, Pico.css, Supabase) and enabled PWA for offline functionality.
Actions: Switched to Pico.css in index.html, added Supabase client in Program.cs, created manifest.json and service-worker.js, and enabled PWA in .csproj.
Outcome: App is now a PWA with offline support via service worker caching; Supabase integration is configured.
Alignment: Prioritized performance (async operations) and readability; used efficient, direct communication with BaaS.
Step 6: Added .gitignore and Configuration Management
Rationale: Prevented committing build artifacts, secrets, and junk files to keep the repository clean.
Actions: Created comprehensive .gitignore (excluding bin/, obj/, IDE files, etc.); set up appsettings.json (committed) and appsettings.Development.json (ignored for local secrets).
Outcome: Repository tracks only source code and essentials; local configs stay secure.
Alignment: Followed best practices for security and simplicity; no "magic" values in code.
Step 7: Committed Changes and Prepared for Review
Rationale: Saved progress on a development branch for version control and collaboration.
Actions: Committed all changes with a concise message ("feat: Project cleanup and MVP foundation setup"); pushed to development branch and created a pull request for review.
Outcome: Changes are staged for merge into main after review.
Alignment: Maintained clear commit history; used descriptive naming and avoided unnecessary complexity.
Current State and Next Steps
Project Status: MVP foundation is completeâ€”clean structure, PWA enabled, and Vertical Slice ready for feature implementation.
Key Achievements: Aligned with all PRD requirements, tech stack, and architectural guidelines; prioritized integration tests and user-friendly error handling.
Future Focus: Implement authentication logic, CRUD operations, and tests; deploy to Azure Static Web Apps.
Philosophy Adherence: Every change emphasized readability, performance, and simplicity, ensuring 10xJournal remains distraction-free.
