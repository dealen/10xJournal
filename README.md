## Project Description

**10xJournal** is a web application designed to be a simple, secure, and private space for regular writing. It addresses the problem of modern note-taking applications that are often bloated with excessive features (complex formatting, databases, templates), creating a barrier to the simple act of writing.

Our solution is to eliminate all unnecessary distractions and focus on the absolute fundamentals. The interface is clean, intuitive, and puts your content first, encouraging the habit of consistent journaling.

**Target Audience:** Users who feel overwhelmed by the complexity of tools like Notion or Obsidian and are looking for a dedicated, straightforward journaling experience.

## Tech Stack
